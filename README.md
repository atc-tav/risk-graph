# Risk · Hex Map & Graph

Reconstructing the classic **Risk** board as a tiled hexagon map in **three.js**, with a
**graph overlay** (territories = nodes, borders = edges) as the foundation for exploring the
board through graph theory.

## The idea

The board's truly important asset is its **adjacency graph**, not the picture. So the project is
split into two layers:

- **Data layer** — canonical, render-agnostic. Drives both the map and all future analysis.
  - [`data/territories.json`](data/territories.json) — the 42 territories, 6 continents (with
    reinforcement bonuses), and the full adjacency list, including the non-geographic sea routes
    (Alaska↔Kamchatka, Brazil↔North Africa, Western Europe↔North Africa, Siam↔Indonesia, …).
  - [`data/shapes.json`](data/shapes.json) — the editable source: each territory's **traced
    outline** as `[col,row]` polygon vertices, plus a `_seas` list of water polygons (island
    channels and inland seas — Great Lakes, Black/Red/Caspian) subtracted from the land.
  - [`data/hexmap.json`](data/hexmap.json) — **generated** by `tools/gen-map.mjs`, which rasterises
    the outlines onto the hex grid at `SCALE` resolution (default 2×, ~4,300 hexes): each hex joins
    the territory it sits deepest inside, so coastlines follow the traced edges, true islands
    (Greenland, Britain, Iceland, Japan, Madagascar, Indonesia, New Guinea) stand free, and
    bordering mainland countries share edges.
- **View layer** — [`src/main.js`](src/main.js) renders the hexes as extruded prisms in three.js,
  coloured by continent, with the graph drawn above the tiles.

Hex math (offset ↔ pixel, centroids, bounds) lives in [`src/hex.js`](src/hex.js) and is shared by
the browser app and the Node preview tool, so the map and the graph never drift apart.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # three.js app at http://localhost:5173
```

Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, hover a territory for its continent/bonus/border count. Toggle the
graph overlay and labels from the HUD.

## Tooling

```bash
node tools/gen-map.mjs [R] [SCALE]   # rasterise shapes.json -> hexmap.json (R=reach, SCALE=res)
npm run validate             # graph + hex checks (see below); also prints an ASCII map
npm run map-preview          # render the hex map to preview.png (no browser needed)
node tools/check-orientation.mjs   # confirm on-screen N/S/E/W without WebGL
```

Workflow for reshaping: edit a polygon in `data/shapes.json` → `node tools/gen-map.mjs` →
`npm run validate` → `npm run map-preview`.

`validate` confirms: **42 territories · 83 undirected edges · 6 continents** (NA 9, SA 4, EU 7,
AF 6, AS 12, AU 4), that **every territory is a contiguous hex blob**, and that **every land
border is realised as two touching hexes**. Genuine water crossings (Alaska↔Kamchatka, the
Mediterranean, islands like Britain/Japan/Madagascar) are listed as `SEA_ROUTES` and allowed to
be gaps.

## Status

- [x] Canonical territory + adjacency data
- [x] Hexagon reconstruction of all 42 territories
- [x] Contiguous continents — land borders touch, water crossings stay gaps
- [x] Traced territory outlines rasterised to hexes (recognisable silhouettes + size variation)
- [x] three.js map rendering (north-up / east-right), continent colouring, hover
- [x] Graph overlay (nodes + edges)
- [ ] Further outline detail per territory (more polygon vertices) as desired
- [ ] Graph-theory analysis: centrality, chokepoints, continent defensibility, cut vertices

## Roadmap toward graph theory

Once the map feels right, the same `territories.json` feeds questions like:
- **Which territories are most important?** — degree / betweenness centrality.
- **Where are the chokepoints?** — cut vertices and bridges (e.g. Central America, the
  Australia/Asia link at Siam).
- **How defensible is a continent?** — count and location of its border territories.
